The Mississippi River is about 2,340 miles long, which makes it the second longest river in the United States (the longest being the Missouri River). It's so long that a single drop of water needs 90 days to travel its entire length!\n",

    "For the time being, we'd just like you to know that we've imported the time module and used the sleep() method to suspend the execution of each subsequent print() function inside the for loop for one second, so that the message outputted to the console resembles an actual counting. Don't worry - you'll soon learn more about modules and methods."

    "In 1937, a German mathematician named Lothar Collatz formulated an intriguing hypothesis (it still remains unproven) which can be described in the following way:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. take any non-negative and non-zero integer number and name it  `c0`;\n",
    "2. if it's even, evaluate a new `c0` as `c0 ÷ 2`;\n",
    "3. otherwise, if it's odd, evaluate a new `c0` as `3 × c0 + 1`;\n",
    "4. if `c0 ≠ 1`, skip to point 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "The hypothesis says that regardless of the initial value of `c0`, it will always go to 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, it's an extremely complex task to use a computer in order to prove the hypothesis for any natural number (it may even require artificial intelligence), but you can use Python to check some individual numbers. Maybe you'll even find the one which would disprove the hypothesis.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Write a program which reads one natural number and executes the above steps as long as `c0` remains different from 1. We also want you to count the steps needed to achieve the goal. Your code should output all the intermediate values of `c0`, too.\n",

    "The Beatles were one of the most popular music group of the 1960s, and the best-selling band in history. Some people consider them to be the most influential act of the rock era. Indeed, they were included in Time magazine's compilation of the 20th Century's 100 most influential people.\n",
    "\n",
    "The band underwent many line-up changes, culminating in 1962 with the line-up of John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison, and Richard Starkey (better known as Ringo Starr).\n",

    "Write a program that reflects these changes and lets you practice with the concept of lists. Your task is to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- step 1: create an empty list named `beatles`;\n",
    "- step 2: use the `append()` method to add the following members of the band to the list: `John Lennon`, `Paul McCartney`, and `George Harrison`;\n",
    "- step 3: use the `for` loop and the `append()` method to prompt the user to add the following members of the band to the list: `Stu Sutcliffe`, and `Pete Best`;\n",
    "- step 4: use the `del` instruction to remove `Stu Sutcliffe` and `Pete Best` from the list;\n",
    "- step 5: use the `insert()` method to add `Ringo Starr` to the beginning of the list.\n",
