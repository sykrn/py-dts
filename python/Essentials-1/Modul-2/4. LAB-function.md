## Estimated time
5-10 minutes

## Level of difficulty
Very Easy

## Objectives
  - becoming familiar with the `print()` function and its formatting capabilities;
  - experimenting with Python code.
## Scenario
Modify the first line of code in the editor, using the `sep` and `end` keywords, to match the expected output. Use the two `print()` functions in the editor.

Don't change anything in the second `print()` invocation.
=====================================
```py
print("Programming","Essentials","in")
print("Python")
```
output
```
Programming Essentials in
Python
```
=====================================
```py
print("Programming","Essentials","in",sep="***",end="...")
print("Python")
```
Expected output
```
Programming***Essentials***in...Python
```

# LAB
## Estimated time
5-15 minutes

## Level of difficulty
Easy

## Objectives
  - experimenting with existing Python code;
  - discovering and fixing basic syntax errors;
  - becoming familiar with the `print()` function and its formatting capabilities.

## Scenario
We strongly encourage you to `play with the code` we've written for you, and make some (maybe even destructive) amendments. Feel free to modify any part of the code, but there is one condition - learn from your mistakes and draw your own conclusions.

Try to:

  - minimize the number of `print()` function invocations by inserting the `\n` sequence into the strings
  - make the arrow twice as large (but keep the proportions)
  - duplicate the arrow, placing both arrows side by side; note: a string may be multiplied by using the following trick: `"string" * 2` will produce `"stringstring"` (we'll tell you more about it soon)
  - remove any of the quotes, and look carefully at Python's response; pay attention to where Python sees an error - is this the place where the error really exists?
  - do the same with some of the parentheses;
  - change any of the `print` words into something else, differing only in case (e.g., `Print`) - what happens now?
  - replace some of the quotes with apostrophes; watch what happens carefully.
=====================================
```py
print("    *")
print("   * *")
print("  *   *")
print(" *     *")
print("***   ***")
print("  *   *")
print("  *   *")
print("  *****")
```
output
```
