# Congratulations!
You have completed Module 1.

Well done! You've reached the end of Module 1 and completed a major milestone in your Python programming education. Here's a short summary of the objectives you've covered and got familiar with in Module 1:

  - the fundamentals of computer programming, i.e., how the computer works, how the program is executed, how the programming language is defined and constructed;
  - the difference between compilation and interpretation;
  - the basic information about Python and how it is positioned among other programming languages, and what distinguishes its different versions;
  - the study resources and different types of interfaces you will be using in the course.

You are now ready to take the module quiz, which will help you gauge what you've learned so far.
