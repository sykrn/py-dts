# PROJECT
## Estimated time
30-120 minutes

## Level of difficulty
Medium/Hard

## Objectives
  - perfecting the student's skills in using Python for solving complex problems,
  - integration of programming techniques in one program consisting of many various parts.

## Scenario
Your task is to write `a simple program which pretends to play tic-tac-toe with the user`. To make it all easier for you, we've decided to simplify the game. Here are our assumptions:

  - the computer (i.e., your program) should play the game using `'X'`s;
  - the user (e.g., you) should play the game using `'O'`s;
  - the first move belongs to the computer - it always puts its first `'X'` in the middle of the board;
  - all the squares are numbered row by row starting with `1` (see the example session below for reference)
  - the user inputs their move by entering the number of the square they choose - the number must be valid, i.e., it must be an integer, it must be greater than 0 and less than `10`, and it cannot point to a field which is already occupied;
  - the program checks if the game is over - there are four possible verdicts: the game should continue, or the game ends with a tie, your win, or the computer's win;
  - the computer responds with its move and the check is repeated;
  - don't implement any form of artificial intelligence - a random field choice made by the computer is good enough for the game.

The example session with the program may look as follows:

# Requirements
Implement the following features:

  - the board should be stored as a three-element list, while each element is another three-element list (the inner lists represent rows) so that all of the squares may be accessed using the following syntax:
    ```s
    board[row][column]
    ```

  - each of the inner list's elements can contain 'O', 'X', or a digit representing the square's number (such a square is considered free)
  - the board's appearance should be exactly the same as the one presented in the example.
  - implement the functions defined for you in the editor.

Drawing a random integer number can be done by utilizing a Python function called `randrange()`. The example program below shows how to use it (the program prints ten random numbers from 0 to 8).

Note: the `from-import` instruction provides an access to the `randrange` function defined within an external Python module callled `random`.
```py
from random import randrange

for i in range(10):
    print(randrange(8))
```

```py
def display_board(board):
    # The function accepts one parameter containing the board's current status
    # and prints it out to the console.


def enter_move(board):
    # The function accepts the board current status, asks the user about their move, 
    # checks the input and updates the board according to the user's decision.


def make_list_of_free_fields(board):
    # The function browses the board and builds a list of all the free squares; 
    # the list consists of tuples, while each tuple is a pair of row and column numbers.


def victory_for(board, sign):
    # The function analyzes the board status in order to check if 
    # the player using 'O's or 'X's has won the game


def draw_move(board):
    # The function draws the computer's move and updates the board.
