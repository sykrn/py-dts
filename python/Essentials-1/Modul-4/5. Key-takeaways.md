# Key takeaways
1. You can pass information to functions by using parameters. Your functions can have as many parameters as you need.

An example of a one-parameter function:
```py
def hi(name):
    print("Hi,", name)

hi("Greg")
```

An example of a two-parameter function:
```py
def hi_all(name_1, name_2):
    print("Hi,", name_2)
    print("Hi,", name_1)

hi_all("Sebastian", "Konrad")
```

An example of a three-parameter function:
```py
def address(street, city, postal_code):
    print("Your address is:", street, "St.,", city, postal_code)

s = input("Street: ")
p_c = input("Postal Code: ")
c = input("City: ")

address(s, c, p_c)
```

2. You can pass arguments to a function using the following techniques:

  - positional argument passing in which the order of arguments passed matters (Ex. 1),
  - keyword (named) argument passing in which the order of arguments passed doesn't matter (Ex. 2),
  - a mix of positional and keyword argument passing (Ex. 3).

## Ex. 1
```py
def subtra(a, b):
    print(a - b)

subtra(5, 2)    # outputs: 3
subtra(2, 5)    # outputs: -3
```

## Ex. 2
```py
def subtra(a, b):
    print(a - b)

subtra(a=5, b=2)    # outputs: 3
subtra(b=2, a=5)    # outputs: 3
```

## Ex. 3
```py
def subtra(a, b):
    print(a - b)

subtra(5, b=2)    # outputs: 3
subtra(5, 2)    # outputs: 3
```

It's important to remember that `positional arguments mustn't follow keyword arguments`. That's why if you try to run the following snippet:
```py
def subtra(a, b):
    print(a - b)

subtra(5, b=2)    # outputs: 3
subtra(a=5, 2)    # Syntax Error
```
Python will not let you do it by signalling a SyntaxError.

3. You can use the keyword argument passing technique to pre-define a value for a given argument:
```py
def name(first_name, last_name="Smith"):
    print(first_name, last_name)

name("Andy")    # outputs: Andy Smith
name("Betty", "Johnson")    # outputs: Betty Johnson (the keyword argument replaced by "Johnson")
```

## Exercise 1
What is the output of the following snippet?
```py
def intro(a="James Bond", b="Bond"):
    print("My name is", b + ".", a + ".")

intro()
```

A: My name is Bond. James Bond.

## Exercise 2
What is the output of the following snippet?
```py
def intro(a="James Bond", b="Bond"):
    print("My name is", b + ".", a + ".")

intro(b="Sean Connery")
```

A: My name is Sean Connery. James Bond.

## Exercise 3
What is the output of the following snippet?
```py
def intro(a, b="Bond"):
    print("My name is", b + ".", a + ".")

intro("Susan")
```

A: My name is Bond. Susan.

## Exercise 4
What is the output of the following snippet?
```py
def add_numbers(a, b=2, c):
    print(a + b + c)

add_numbers(a=1, c=3)
```

A: `SyntaxError` - a non-default argument (`c`) follows a default argument (`b=2`)
