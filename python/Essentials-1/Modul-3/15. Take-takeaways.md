# Key takeaways

1. Python supports the following logical operators:

  - `and` → if both operands are true, the condition is true, e.g., (`True and True`) is `True`,
  - `or` → if any of the operands are true, the condition is true, e.g., (`True or False`) is `True`,
  - `not` → returns false if the result is true, and returns true if the result is false, e.g., `not True` is `False`.

2. You can use bitwise operators to manipulate single bits of data. The following sample data:

  - `x = 15`, which is `0000 1111` in binary,
  - `y = 16`, which is `0001 0000` in binary.

will be used to illustrate the meaning of bitwise operators in Python. Analyze the examples below:

  - `&` does a bitwise and, e.g., `x & y = 0`, which is `0000 0000` in binary,
  - `|` does a bitwise or, e.g., `x | y = 31`, which is `0001 1111` in binary,
  - `˜`  does a bitwise not, e.g., `˜ x = 240*`, which is `1111 0000` in binary,
  - `^` does a bitwise xor, e.g., `x ^ y = 31`, which is `0001 1111` in binary,
  - `>>` does a bitwise right shift, e.g., `y >> 1 = 8`, which is `0000 1000` in binary,
  - `<<` does a bitwise left shift, e.g., `y << 3 = `, which is `1000 0000` in binary,

## Exercise 1
What is the output of the following snippet?
```py
x = 1
y = 0

z = ((x == y) and (x == y)) or not(x == y)
print(not(z))
```
A: False

## Exercise 2
What is the output of the following snippet?
```py
x = 4
y = 1

a = x & y
b = x | y
c = ~x  # tricky!
d = x ^ 5
e = x >> 2
f = x << 2

print(a, b, c, d, e, f)
```
A: 0 5 -5 1 1 16
