## Estimated time
5 minutes

## Level of difficulty
Very easy

## Objectives
Familiarize the student with:

  - using basic instructions related to lists;

## Scenario
There once was a hat. The hat contained no rabbit, but a list of five numbers: `1`, `2`, `3`, `4`, and `5`.

Your task is to:

  - write a line of code that prompts the user to replace the middle number in the list with an integer number entered by the user (Step 1)
  - write a line of code that removes the last element from the list (Step 2)
  - write a line of code that prints the length of the existing list (Step 3).

Ready for this challenge?
```py
hat_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]  # This is an existing list of numbers hidden in the hat.

# Step 1: write a line of code that prompts the user
# to replace the middle number with an integer number entered by the user.

# Step 2: write a line of code that removes the last element from the list.

# Step 3: write a line of code that prints the length of the existing list.

print(hat_list)
```
