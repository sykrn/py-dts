## Estimated time
5-10 minutes

## Level of difficulty
Very Easy

## Objectives
  - becoming familiar with the the input() function;
  - becoming familiar with comparison operators in Python.

## Scenario
Using one of the comparison operators in Python, write a simple two-line program that takes the parameter `n` as input, which is an integer, and prints `False` if `n` is less than `100`, and `True` if `n` is greater than or equal to `100`.

Don't create any if blocks (we're going to talk about them very soon). Test your code using the data we've provided for you.

## Test Data
```py
var = 0  # Assigning 0 to var
print(var == 0)

var = 1  # Assigning 1 to var
print(var == 0)
```
