# LAB: Counting stack
## Estimated time
20-45 minutes

## Level of difficulty
Easy/Medium

## Objectives

  - improve the student's skills in defining classes;
  - using existing classes to create new classes equipped with new functionalities.

## Scenario
We've showed you recently how to extend Stack possibilities by defining a new class (i.e., a subclass) which retains all inherited traits and adds some new ones.

Your task is to extend the `Stack` class behavior in such a way so that the class is able to count all the elements that are pushed and popped (we assume that counting pops is enough). Use the `Stack` class we've provided in the editor.

Follow the hints:

  - introduce a property designed to count pop operations and name it in a way which guarantees hiding it;
  - initialize it to zero inside the constructor;
  - provide a method which returns the value currently assigned to the counter (name it `get_counter()`).

Complete the code in the editor. Run it to check whether your code outputs 100.
```py
class Stack:
    def __init__(self):
        self.__stk = []

    def push(self, val):
        self.__stk.append(val)

    def pop(self):
        val = self.__stk[-1]
        del self.__stk[-1]
        return val


class CountingStack(Stack):
    def __init__(self):
    #
    # Fill the constructor with appropriate actions.
    #

    def get_counter(self):
    #
    # Present the counter's current value to the world.
    #

    def pop(self):
    #
    # Do pop and update the counter.
    #
	

stk = CountingStack()
for i in range(100):
    stk.push(i)
    stk.pop()
print(stk.get_counter())
```
