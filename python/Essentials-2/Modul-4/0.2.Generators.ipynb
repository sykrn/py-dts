    "# A brief look at closures\n",
    "Let's start with a definition: `closure is a technique which allows the storing of values in spite of the fact that the context in which they have been created does not exist anymore`. Intricate? A bit.\n",

    "\n",
    "The last two lines will cause a NameError exception - neither `par` nor `loc` is accessible outside the function. Both the variables exist when and only when the `outer()` function is being executed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Look at the example in the editor. We've modified the code significantly.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a brand new element in it - a function (named `inner`) inside another function (named `outer`).\n",
    "\n",
    "How does it work? Just like any other function except for the fact that `inner()` may be invoked only from within `outer()`. We can say that `inner()` is `outer()`'s private tool - no other part of the code can access it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Look carefully:\n",
    "\n",
    "  - the `inner()` function returns the value of the variable accessible inside its scope, as `inner()` can use any of the entities at the disposal of `outer()`\n",
    "  - the `outer()` function returns the `inner()` function itself; more precisely, it returns a copy of the `inner()` function, the one which was frozen at the moment of `outer()`'s invocation; the frozen function contains its full environment, including the state of all local variables, which also means that the value of `loc` is successfully retained, although `outer()` ceased to exist a long time ago.\n",
    "\n",
    "In effect, the code is fully valid, and outputs:\n",
    "```s\n",
    "1\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
