## Estimated time
20-25 minutes

## Level of difficulty
Medium

## Objectives
  - improving the student's skills in operating with strings;
  - using built-in Python string methods.

## Scenario
You already know how `split()` works. Now we want you to prove it.

Your task is to `write your own function, which behaves almost exactly like the original split() method`, i.e.:

  - it should accept exactly one argument - a string;
  - it should return a list of words created from the string, divided in the places where the string contains whitespaces;
  - if the string is empty, the function should return an empty list;
  - its name should be `mysplit()`

Use the template in the editor. Test your code carefully.
```py
def mysplit(strng):
    #
    # put your code here
    #


print(mysplit("To be or not to be, that is the question"))
print(mysplit("To be or not to be,that is the question"))
print(mysplit("   "))
print(mysplit(" abc "))
print(mysplit(""))
```

# Expected output
```s
['To', 'be', 'or', 'not', 'to', 'be,', 'that', 'is', 'the', 'question']
['To', 'be', 'or', 'not', 'to', 'be,that', 'is', 'the', 'question']
[]
['abc']
[]
```
