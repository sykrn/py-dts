# Key takeaways

1. Computers store characters as numbers. There is more than one possible way of encoding characters, but only some of them gained worldwide popularity and are commonly used in IT: these are `ASCII` (used mainly to encode the Latin alphabet and some of its derivates) and `UNICODE` (able to encode virtually all alphabets being used by humans).

2. A number corresponding to a particular character is called a `codepoint`.

3. UNICODE uses different ways of encoding when it comes to storing the characters using files or computer memory: two of them are `UCS-4` and `UTF-8` (the latter is the most common as it wastes less memory space).

## Exercise 1
What is BOM?
A: BOM (Byte Order Mark) is a special combination of bits announcing encoding used by a file's content (eg. UCS-4 or UTF-B).

## Exercise 2
Is Python 3 I18Ned?
A: Yes, it's completely internationalized - we can use UNICODE characters inside our code, read them from input and send to output.
