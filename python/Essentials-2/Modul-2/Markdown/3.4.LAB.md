# LAB: Reading ints safely
## Estimated time
15-25 minutes

## Level of difficulty
Medium

## Objectives
  - improving the student's skills in defining functions;
  - using exceptions in order to provide a safe input environment.

## Scenario
Your task is to write a `function able to input integer values and to check if they are within a specified range`.

The function should:

  - accept three arguments: a prompt, a low acceptable limit, and a high acceptable limit; 
  - if the user enters a string that is not an integer value, the function should emit the message `Error: wrong input`, and ask the user to input the value again;
  - if the user enters a number which falls outside the specified range, the function should emit the message `Error: the value is not within permitted range (min..max)` and ask the user to input the value again;
  - if the input value is valid, return it as a result.

# Test data
Test your code carefully.
```py
def read_int(prompt, min, max):
    #
    # Write your code here.
    #


v = read_int("Enter a number from -10 to 10: ", -10, 10)

print("The number is:", v)
```

This is how the function should react to the user's input:
```s
Enter a number from -10 to 10: 100
Error: the value is not within permitted range (-10..10)
Enter a number from -10 to 10: asd
Error: wrong input
Enter number from -10 to 10: 1
The number is: 1
```
